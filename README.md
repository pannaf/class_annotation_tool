# Classification Annotation Tool

The **Cl**assification **A**nnotation **T**ool can be used to annotate images or videos with classification labels. This tool allows you to label many media at once, so you save time not needing to individually scroll through each media item. In my experience, anywhere between 500-1500 media can be labeled in an hour.
